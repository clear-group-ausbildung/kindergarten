 * This class has been designed to show a splash quickly. It aims to load as few
 * framework classes as possible. Therefore it has been separated from the
 * Application class (reduces the number of imports). And it doesn't use the
 * Application framework resource support, just to avoid the initialization of
 * the full ResourceMap hierarchy which may be packed with quite a lot of keys
 * that we don't need at this time.
